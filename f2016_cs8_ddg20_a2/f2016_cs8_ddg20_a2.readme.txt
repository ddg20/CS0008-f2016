First initialize variables for partial and total distance and number of lines. Then ask for file name to input
and as long as the file name is not "quit" or "q" (input validation), then the program will continue to open the file to
read and call the processFile function, which will read each line and take away the new line using the rstrip method.
Then it will split the name and the distance through the split function with the comma and then assign the distance variable to
the second element in the list (the float). Then the function ends with the partial distance and partial number of lines
in that file being summed up. After the processFile function is carried out, the printKV function is then called which
will take into account each case (string, float, and int) and then format the appropriate number of spaces/decimal places.
Then the file will close and the total distance and total number of lines will be added together. Then it will ask
for the next file to be inputted until the user enters "quit" or "q".
