First I created a Participant class and initialized the name, distance, and runs variables. Then I defined the __init__
method that accepts the name and distance as arguments. Then I defined the addDistance method and the add distances
methods which adds a single distance to the distance accumulator, and adds an array of distances to the distance
accumulator, respectively. Then I defined the getName, getDistance, and getRuns methods which returns the name,
distance, and number of runs. I then defined the __str__ method which stringifies the object. Now the class is done.

Now I've defined the getDataFromFile method which opens the file and and reads through each line. The method also strips
the newline character and splits the name and the distance, and appends that list to a dictionary. Then I initialized
the number of files, total lines, and total distance run variables. The min distance and max distances are also defined
using the min and max functions. Then everything is formatted as shown in the assignment plan and set so that the strings
will be 20 characters long, total distance run with 9 digits, decimal point and 4 decimals, and the number of runs with
4 digits and no decimals. Then another file is created and written with every object, and then the file is closed.
