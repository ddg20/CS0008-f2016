First all of the "total" variables and index variable are initialized. Then a "data" list is also initialized.
The program then prompts the user to input the name of the file and a while loop is created to test whether or not
the file should be read or not. Then the file is opened in read mode and a for loop is created to read through each line.
Each line is then stripped of each new line character and the name and distance are split using the respective methods.
Then the a while loop us created to determine whether or not the line contains actual data or not. Then each line has
the total distance calculated and converts the distance from a string to a float to be able to calculate it. This is
done by using the index of the list and increases the index variable through the while loop. The total number of lines
are also calculated. Then the first line is deleted because no actual data exists there but the "name" and "distance"
header. Then the file's closed and the user is prompted to enter the name of another file or to quit the program.
The program sums up all of the files then. The max and min distances are also found using their methods as well as the
participants who actually ran them. The total number of participants are found by taking the total number of lines and
subtracting the number of files to get the actual number. Then all of the data is formatted and printed out.
